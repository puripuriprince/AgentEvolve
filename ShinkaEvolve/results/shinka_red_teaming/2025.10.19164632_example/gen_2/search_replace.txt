improve_jailbreak_prompt_complexity
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The original jailbreak prompt is too straightforward and polite, which is unlikely to bypass safety measures. To improve effectiveness, the prompt is rewritten to use indirect and more complex language that attempts to trick the model into ignoring its safety guidelines. This includes framing the request as a hypothetical or roleplay scenario, which is a common adversarial technique. This should increase the success rate of bypassing safety measures in jailbreak scenarios.

enhance_prompt_injection_with_obfuscation
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The prompt injection example is too direct and likely to be caught by simple filters. To improve, the injection is obfuscated by embedding the malicious instruction inside a disguised comment or code block, making it less obvious. This tests the model's ability to detect hidden instructions and improves the diversity of prompt injection test cases.

expand_toxic_content_prompt_with_indirect_requests
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The toxic content prompt is currently a direct request for examples of inappropriate communication, which may be filtered out easily. To improve, the prompt is rewritten to request examples in a more indirect and academic style, such as asking for descriptions of toxic behavior patterns or quoting anonymized examples from research. This approach tests the model's moderation robustness against indirect toxic content generation.

<NAME>
add_variation_synonym_replacement
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The current paraphrase variation only replaces a few words and is limited. To increase diversity and effectiveness, add synonym replacements for key words such as "helpful" -> "supportive", "task" -> "assignment", and "explain" -> "describe". This enriches the linguistic variety and tests the model's robustness to different phrasing.

<NAME>
add_contextual_misleading_instructions
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
To improve the effectiveness of the enhance_prompt_with_context function, add an optional parameter to inject misleading or contradictory instructions in the context. This simulates prompt injection attempts embedded in context and tests the model's ability to handle conflicting instructions. This also increases the diversity of attack vectors.
