expanded_scenario_prompts
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Enhanced the base prompts for each scenario by adding more diverse and sophisticated adversarial instructions.
This helps cover a wider range of potential bypass attempts, including indirect or disguised attacks.
We also increased prompt complexity and semantic variety to improve the testing robustness and likelihood of bypassing.

diverse_variation_strategies
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Added more nuanced variation types to generate semantically diverse test cases.
For example, 'reverse' inverts requests, and 'code_switch' mixes formal and informal language to simulate adversarial linguistic patterns.
This diversity helps test different linguistic bypass approaches.

add_context_keywords_to_enhance
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Improved the enhance_prompt_with_context function to optionally insert keywords or phrases that simulate attacker context,
such as "Ignore previous instructions," "Test internal behavior," or "Bypass filters," enhancing indirect injection attempts.
This complements the context parameter by injecting subtle adversarial signal cues.
