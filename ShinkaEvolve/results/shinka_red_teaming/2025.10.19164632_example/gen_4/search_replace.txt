add_dynamic_prompt_injection
</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Implement a dynamic prompt injection technique that subtly embeds malicious instructions within user instructions, making adversarial prompts harder to detect and increasing the likelihood of bypassing safety measures during testing. This approach enhances attack diversity by simulating real-world prompt injection scenarios where malicious payloads are often hidden within legitimate user inputs.
