add_dynamic_prompt_injection
</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a mechanism to embed malicious or misleading instructions directly into the prompt, simulating prompt injection attacks. This enhances testing of the LLM's robustness against subtle injection techniques that can bypass safety filters. The injection is dynamically inserted into the prompt based on scenario, making the attack more realistic and varied.
