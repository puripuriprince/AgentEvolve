outer_ring_and_fine_edge_corners
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This edit targets the arrangement of the 26 circle centers, inspired by best-known hybrid packings with a larger, denser outer ring. Specifically:
- Replace the "inner ring" of 8 with a 12-point outer ring (radius ~0.41), which fits better with 26 and is closer to the geometry of best-known arrangements.
- Use the remaining 4 circles to fill in strategic interstitial positions between the rings, corners, and edges.
- Slightly increase the minimum boundary offset for safety.
- This gives better edge utilization, more central space, and more flexible overlap avoidance, thus should increase the combined score, moving the packing closer to known optimal forms.
