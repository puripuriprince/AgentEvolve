central_priority_and_outer_ring_redistribution
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The current approach uses a jittered central grid and a non-uniform outer ring. However, the central grid may cause excessive local crowding, while the outer ring is quite "thin" and does not leverage the square's geometry for maximal radii. To improve, I propose:
1. Place a large circle at the very center (0.5, 0.5) as in many optimal arrangements, which often allows that circle to be larger than a grid point.
2. Reduce the central grid size to 2x2 (excluding the center), to reduce inner crowding.
3. Redistribute the outer ring to 12 points (rather than 9), which allows a more regular, hexagonal-like layout and better fills the space between edge-centers and corners.
4. Use adaptive angular and radius jitter for outer ring points to avoid symmetry and to repel from edges/corners.
5. Keep the 8 edge/corner positions, as these are optimal for variable-sized circles at the square's limits.

This hybrid (1+4+4+4+12=25, but we want 26) can be corrected by adding a single interstitial circle (e.g., on diagonal, between center and corner).

This approach is inspired by the best-known literature and the previous best code, but increases the outer ring density and gives more "priority" to the central region.

I will rewrite the search block accordingly.
