shrink_outer_ring_add_interstitials
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Currently, the outer ring contains 8 circles, each elongated along a diagonal ellipse to reduce crowding. However, the inner 3x3 grid may not fully exploit the space between the central region and the outer ring, and the outer ring may be slightly too far out, leading to inefficient use of area near the edges/corners.

To improve:
- Slightly shrink the "outer" ring (reduce its semi-axes by ~3%) to open up space between the outer ring and the square's borders.
- Add two extra "interstitial" circles: one placed along the main diagonal between the center and the farthest corner, and one along the other diagonal, but not coinciding with any grid point or outer ring.
- These interstitials fill otherwise underutilized space, a method which has improved dense packings in the literature for n~25-30.

Adjust the code to:
- Place the 8 outer ring points with a slightly smaller ellipse (outer_a, outer_b reduced).
- After those, add two explicit interstitials, placed at 5/8 of the way from the center to opposite corners, with a jitter so they don't overlap with grid or ring points.
- Update assertion and radii calculation accordingly.

This should increase the sum of radii by better exploiting the "gaps" between the ring and corners and the center.
