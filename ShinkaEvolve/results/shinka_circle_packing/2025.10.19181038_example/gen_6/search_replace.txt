<DESCRIPTION>
Instead of using two rings and a center, strategically place circles at the four corners and the centers of the four edges of the square, maximizing radius locally for those 8 positions. Then, fill the interior with one large center circle and the remaining 17 circles in two quasi-hexagonal layers (an inner ring of 6 and an outer ring of 11), favoring larger circles near the center and smaller near the corners/edges. This hybrid strategy leverages the square's geometry and edge effects and is common in best-known packings for n in the mid-20s. The initial placement increases possible radii for edge and corner circles, leading to a higher sum after adjusting.
