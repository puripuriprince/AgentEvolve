hex_dodec_gradient_full_edge_corner
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The current approach omits three corners and two edge centers, which are typically favorable locations for larger circles due to available space. Instead, I propose a structure inspired by successful prior arrangements:
- Keep the layered symmetry (central, hex, dodecagon rings) but *fully* populate all four corners and four edge centers, as this usually increases the sum of radii for modest n.
- Slightly contract the dodecagon ring to r=0.395 to avoid excessive crowding with the newly added edge/corner circles.
- Remove the third "octagon" ring (which crowds the square's periphery) and instead use those 8 slots for 4 corners and 4 edge centers, placing them inset for larger radii.
- Slightly increase the first and second ring radii to better utilize central square space.
- Adjust local repulsion to allow slightly larger minimum distances for better edge/corner expansion.

This change is a hybrid of the best previously performing patterns and should yield a higher combined score.
