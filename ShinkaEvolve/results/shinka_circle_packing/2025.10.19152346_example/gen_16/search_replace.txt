corner_edge_placement_and_adaptive_radii
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This edit adds a hybridized approach to the packing arrangement:
- 4 "anchor" circles are placed directly at the corners, optimally utilizing square real estate.
- 8 circles are placed at the middle of the square's edges and quarter-points along the edges, as edge-located circles tend to be slightly larger than those in the bulk.
- The remaining 14 circles are distributed in a variable "inner" and "outer" ring around the center, as in the previous best program, but with the number and pattern now adapted to account for the fixed edges/corners.
Additionally, the initial radii of the circles are estimated according to their location:
- Corner circles get the maximum possible radius (distance to sides).
- Edge circles get an initial radius based on their minimum distance to adjacent corners and edges.
- The rest receive radii according to the local density/estimated available space.
This mix should allow for larger circles at boundaries, while the interior arranges itself flexibly.
Finally, the adjustable ring radii are tuned via a sweep as before for the best configuration.

This variable-density approach harnesses key insights from computational geometry on boundary effects, and empirical evidence that tight packings for small n often utilize the corners and edges explicitly.
