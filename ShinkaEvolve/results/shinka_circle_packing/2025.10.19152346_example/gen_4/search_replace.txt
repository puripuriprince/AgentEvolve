<DESCRIPTION>
Inspired by the insight that strategic placement of circles at the corners and edges of the square can improve the sum of radii, I propose modifying the arrangement to explicitly place 4 circles at the corners and 8 at the midpoints of the square's edges, maximizing their possible radii. The remaining 14 circles are arranged in two inner rings as before, but with slightly reduced radii to allow more space for the large corner and edge circles. This hybrid approach leverages the fact that circles touching the square's boundary can have larger radii, and placing them at the corners and edges makes optimal use of available space.
