hybrid_corner_edge_center
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The current arrangement uses a central circle, an inner ring, and an outer ring, but the outer ring is forced into a circular pattern, which is not optimal for a square. Inspired by best-known packings, I propose a hybrid approach: place circles at the four corners, at the midpoints of the edges, and at the center, then fill in the remaining circles in two rings (one close to the center, one closer to the edges but not at the very edge). This leverages the square's geometry, allows larger circles at the center, and places smaller ones at the corners/edges, which is known to improve the sum of radii for n=26. This arrangement should yield a higher combined score.

    # Place circles in a structured pattern
    # This is a simple pattern - evolution will improve this

    # First, place a large circle in the center
    centers[0] = [0.5, 0.5]

    # Place 8 circles around it in a ring
    for i in range(8):
        angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 8
        centers[i + 1] = [0.5 + 0.3 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.3 * np.sin(angle)]

    # Place 16 more circles in an outer ring
    for i in range(16):
        angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 16
        centers[i + 9] = [0.5 + 0.7 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.7 * np.sin(angle)]

    # Additional positioning adjustment to make sure all circles
    # are inside the square and don't overlap
    # Clip to ensure everything is inside the unit square
    centers = np.clip(centers, 0.01, 0.99)
