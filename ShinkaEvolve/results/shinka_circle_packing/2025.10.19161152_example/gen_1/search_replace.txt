corner_edge_placement

<DESCRIPTION>
The original construction places a central circle, a ring of 8 circles, and an outer ring of 16, with all outermost circles clipped, leading to waste at the corners and edges. Drawing on geometric packing insight, we can improve the packing by explicitly placing circles at each of the four square corners and the centers of the four edges. The remaining circles can then be distributed in two ringsâ€”a smaller inner ring and a larger outer ring concentrated toward the sides but not forced to the extreme corners. This hybrid approach better utilizes the square's geometry, especially the underused corners and edges, and should increase the achievable sum of radii.

    # Place 16 more circles in an outer ring
    for i in range(16):
        angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 16
        centers[i + 9] = [0.5 + 0.7 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.7 * np.sin(angle)]

    # are inside the square and don't overlap
    # Clip to ensure everything is inside the unit square
