<DESCRIPTION>
The current configuration uses 4 corners, 8 edge/near-edge, and 14 in two inner rings plus center. The arrangement could be improved by clustering more small circles near the corners and edges (where large circles don't fit), and rebalancing the rings. Inspired by hybrid packings, let's:
- Place 4 at the corners (slightly closer to edges to make more room in the interior).
- Place 10 on edges (3 along each long edge, 2 on each short edge, away from corners).
- Use a central circle, and then two densely-packed inner rings (6 and 5), for a total of 1+4+10+6+5=26.
- Edge circles are better spread inwards from the border to allow slightly larger radii.
- The two rings are "twisted" so that circles are not aligned; this helps with denser packing.
This arrangement should improve the combined score by better using the available space, especially along the edges and corners.
