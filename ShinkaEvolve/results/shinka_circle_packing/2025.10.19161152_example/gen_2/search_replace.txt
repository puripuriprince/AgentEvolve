<DESCRIPTION>
The current arrangement uses two concentric rings, but the best-known results for n=26 circles in a square use a hybrid approach: one circle at the center, circles near the corners, and circles along the edges, with additional rings. The prior best solution places circles at the corners and edge centers, then fills rings in between. The outermost circles are not at the very edge/corner but slightly inset. This arrangement is more flexible and fits larger circles.

This edit proposes a hybrid:
- Place the center circle.
- Place 4 circles near the corners (but not exactly at the corner).
- Place 4 at the edge centers.
- Place 8 in an inner ring (octagon).
- Place 9 in an outer ring (nonagon, slightly inset).
This closely models the best-known manual construction and likely improves the combined score.

The radii are computed as before, but the new structure will allow for larger sum of radii.
